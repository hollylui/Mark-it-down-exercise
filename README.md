## In this morning 
**It just happened** in this morning but I don’t remember why I made swiss roll. 

*I guess that* my kid saw a video about swiss roll. She keeps asking me the whole day. So, here I am, making a swiss roll.

## Ingredients
|Butter|Egg White|Powder Sugar| Cake Flour| Colour|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|10g|10g|10g|10g|Red and green|

<br><br>
**Cake flour**: It is not easy to find cake flour in Germany. I used one cup of flour No. 405. Remove 2 tablespoons and add back 2 tablespoons of corn starch/corn flour.
## Messy Starts
**For Strawberry Pattern**: mix all ingredients well. Separate into 3 portions: one for green colour, one for light red colour and one for red colour. Put each colour into pipping bag (I used up all my pipping bag. So, I made my own one with baking paper.)

<br><br>

**For Swiss Roll**: separate egg white and egg yolk. In the bowl of egg white, add vinegar and whip it and add 60g of sugar from time to time. When you can put the egg white on top of your head, it can be stopped.
<br><br>

Mix the rest of the ingredients with egg yolk (btw, no butter you needed. No idea why I prepared butter here). When it is smooth, you can add a little bit of egg white mix. Fold properly and then fold the rest of the egg white mix.

<br><br>
**The Filling**: according to the package and whip the cream. Add two packs of vanilla sugar from time to time. Wash and cut the strawberry into small pieces.
<br><br>
**Combine Together**: Put the cake upside down. Spread the whipped cream and spread the strawberries on top of whipped cream. Roll the cake carefully and place it into the fridge for 1 to 2 hours.

> I spent two hours on it with my kid. My family tried the edge of the cake (as it is still in the fridge), they both said it is good but I haven’t yet as I am quite tired now…
